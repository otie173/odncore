## The idea
The goal of the core is to be easy to use and understand, and this applies to:
- the core code
- how it works
- the settings of the core itself

Unlike cores of other games like Minecraft, where the core is the brain of the whole system, Odncore serves as an intermediary between clients. It simply:
- passes packets from client to client
- allows clients to process these packets

This makes the core not the most important part of the system, but rather a facilitator of communication between clients.
