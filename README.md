## The idea
The goal of the core is to be easy to use and understand, and this applies to the core code, how it works, and the settings of the core itself. It may be different from the cores of other games like Minecraft, in the sense that in those games the core is the brain of the whole thing, but in the case of Odncore the core is not the most important thing, it is just an intermediary between clients and only passes packets from client to client, and those in turn process these packets.
